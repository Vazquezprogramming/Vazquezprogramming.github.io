### CPSC 120:

Lab 5:
I liked Lab 5 because of its use of vectors.  This lab helped me understand the use of a command line beyond just running a program.  This lab aslo helped me understand how to index a vector.

Lab 6:
I liked Lab 6 because of its use of nested for-loops.  It showed me how to carefully nest loops to create the expected output.  It also has showed me how to create infinite loops.

Lab 7:
I liked lab 7 because of its use of function calls.  In this lab, I learned how to write separate functions and how to call them in the main function.  I have also learned how much simpler programs are with function calls.
